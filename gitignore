How to unignore a specific file inside Debug folder?

vishwasgupta commented on Feb 9, 2019
I have checked in all the files bin , suo etc on git. Now each time when I build the solution my dll got updated and git desktop suggest me to checked in those changes. I don't want to checked those (.dll and .pdb files). Can anyone help me here?

Grauldon commented on Apr 20, 2019
@Genebi Use the ! (Not) operator.

!path/filename

Grauldon commented on Apr 20, 2019 • 
@kmorcinek The following commands also work for downloading when using Git for Windows:

curl -Of https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kmorcinek/2710267/raw/.gitignore

@Grauldon thx, done. (added)

@vishwasgupta you need to delete them all and then make a commit that deletes them.

Author
kmorcinek commented on Apr 21, 2019
@Genebi you can also add one file explicit, like:
git add -f my/ignore/file.foo

Thanks a lot for the sharing ! GitHub should add your gitIgnore in ".gitignore template". They currently have nothing for C# projects ! :'(
